My final year university project, uses FAST and BREIF to detect features in an image, ready for image classification

Abstract:
<p align="center">
Humans have the innate ability to look at objects and patterns and be able to identify and classify them. Computers however, lack this, they can't just be given an image to say that it is this or that, this is where the area of computer vision comes in. I will be creating a system using two techniques called FAST: Faster and Better, a corner detector and BRIEF: Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features, a descriptor, to extract features in a given image. This system will effectively give a computer eyes and give them the ability to pick out interesting features of images and describe them using binary numbers. You can go on to implement this system in a classification software to allow the computer to classify different objects or scenes in an image.
